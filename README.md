Library Management System

This is a simple and lightweight Library Management System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a basic backend-friendly structure. The goal of this project is to demonstrate user management, book management, and core CRUD operations in a clean and organized way.

Features
	1.	User Management

	•	Sign up
	•	Login
	•	Session validation (frontend placeholder logic)

	2.	Book Management

	•	Add a new book
	•	Edit book details
	•	Delete a book (UI only — backend can be connected later)
	•	View all books in a structured table layout

	3.	Simple UI

	•	Separate HTML, CSS, and JS files for easy updates
	•	A clean base layout that can be expanded or integrated with frameworks

	4.	Backend-Ready Structure

	•	Organized folders that make it easy to integrate with Django, Node.js, ASP.NET, or any backend framework

How the Project Works

The user starts by signing up or logging in.
After authentication, they are redirected to the home.html page.
From there, they can add books, view the book list, or edit book information.

All pages follow the same structure:
	•	HTML file
	•	CSS file
	•	JavaScript file
This approach makes the project easy to maintain and extend.

Future Improvements
	•	Connect the system to a backend using Django or Node.js
	•	Add a database such as MySQL, SQLite, or MongoDB
	•	Add admin roles and permissions
	•	Implement real authentication using JWT
	•	Add search and filtering features
	•	Add book categories
	•	Support dark mode
	•	Improve and modernize the UI

Why This Project?

This project is great for beginners who want to learn frontend fundamentals, understand project structure, build CRUD systems, or prepare for backend integration. It also makes a solid addition to a GitHub portfolio.
